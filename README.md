This repository contains multiple Python functions designed to solve distinct problems, listed below:

## Converting a binary array to a decimal number:
### Description

This project implements a function that converts a binary array (series of 0s and 1s) to its corresponding decimal (base-10) value.

### Features

* Handles binary arrays of any length.
* Efficiently calculates the decimal value using bitwise operations (optional: add this line if applicable).
*Efficiently calculates the decimal value using bitwise operations 
## Finding the complementary DNA strand, C and G, and T and A; automatically 

### Description

This project automates finding the complementary DNA strand based on the principle that Adenine (A) pairs with Thymine (T), and Cytosine (C) pairs with Guanine (G).

### Features

* Takes a DNA strand (string) as input.
* Outputs the complementary DNA strand.
* Handles both uppercase and lowercase letters (optional: specify if applicable).
## Paino Tiles Game Bot

### Description

This project automates playing the Paino Tiles game by detecting black pixels at user-specified click locations.

### Features

* Allows user to define click coordinates.
* Analyses the screen for black pixels at those coordinates.

## No Duplicates Script

### Description

This script ensures a sequence (list or array) contains no duplicate elements by comparing each element to the previous ones.

### Features

* Takes a sequence of elements as input.
* Removes any duplicate elements from the sequence.
* Maintains the order of unique elements (optional: specify if applicable).

## Highest and Lowest 
### Description

The high_and_low function takes a string of numbers separated by spaces and returns the highest and lowest numbers in the sequence.

### Features 

* Input: Accepts a string of numbers separated by spaces.
* Output: Returns a string containing the highest and lowest numbers separated by a space.
* Error Handling: Assumes valid input format (numbers separated by spaces).
* Efficiency: Utilizes Python's built-in min() and max() functions for optimal performance.
* String Formatting: Uses Python's f-string for clear and concise output formatting.

## Hashtag Generator

### Description
* Generate a hashtag from a given string.

### Features

* Takes out spaces 
* Capitalises the first letter 
* Does not allow empty input

## Index Position
### Description 
* Converts the input text to a string.


### Features

* Iterates over each character in the string.
* Checks if the character is an alphabetic letter.
* Converts each alphabetic letter to its corresponding position in the alphabet:
* Converts the letter to lowercase.
* Computes the position using the ASCII value.
* Adds the position to a list.
* Returns the list of alphabetic positions.
